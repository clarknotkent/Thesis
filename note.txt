---- BACKEND ----

can u clean my backend and check if everything is necessary? check if all are still connected to whats in the database, u can refer to the schema overview.txt and triggers & functions.txt--i already updated their contents

(you can list all triggers, functions, and routines, then describe them and did any of them overlapped or contradicted?)

i have functions and triggers already in the database, and in the backend, there are also functions right? are any of them overlaps or contradicts? can u please scan and check everyhting
