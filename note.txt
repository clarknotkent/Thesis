- Must Finalize/Maximize Activity Logging
- Must always update schema overview.txt
- Make sure all buttons and CRUDs are working perfectly
- Make sure all created_by and updated_by is being inserted

- Try all CRUDs
- Get/Utilize All necessary Views
- Repopulate Everything (with decent examples)
- Why is the Inventory History not being updated each time inventory changes (like updates on stock--its name, brands, quantity, etc)?


---- FRONTEND ----

- Apply the Toast in Everything (remove the prompts--sytem-like notifications--in deleting too) **SEMI-FINISHED**
- Apply Smart Dose Dropdown (must be derived from the schedule_doses) **SEMI-FINISHED** //currently working if no history for any vaccinations yet
- Make all dropdowns to accept inputs too (for searching through options) **SEMI-FINISHED**
- Added Record per Visit Should be Editable (Optional) **SEMI-FINISHED** //can click edit, but it suddenly saves the whole record
- Disease Prevented should be a Dropdown that shows all Disease Prevented list, then can also accept Input for new Disease Prevented or to search the list (must also be applied to Antigen Name, Brand Name, Manufacturer, and Storage Location, also the Mother and Father full name in adding Patients) **SEMI-FINISHED** //currently wors as suggestions??

- Implement Deworm & Vitamin
- Fix the Date Fields
- Fix the Modals
- Make sure that all fields are well-mapped (must prefill/occupy/populate necessary fields)
- Make the Dashboard work
- In Guardian UI, Guardians can edit their profile (include occupation and alt phone number)
- View Visit Should Include Whether Transaction was Outside or Not
- Edit Inventory Details should already prefill all fields and the antigen and brand name must be readonly
- Once Inventory Stock is deleted, should I be able to restore it? (or no need for restoration?)

can u clean my backend and check if everything is necessary? check if all are still connected to whats in the database, u can refer to the schema overview.txt and triggers & functions.txt--i already updated their contents

(you can list all triggers, functions, and routines, then describe them and did any of them overlapped or contradicted?)

i have functions and triggers already in the database, and in the backend, there are also functions right? are any of them overlaps or contradicts? can u please scan and check everyhting

why do visits dont have created and updated by and recorded_by
