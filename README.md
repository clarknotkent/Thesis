#  Vue Task Tracker PWA
A simple, modern, and offline-first task management application built with Vue.js and Vite. This project serves as a practical guide to understanding Progressive Web App (PWA) concepts, including service workers, offline capabilities, and installability, all while providing a functional task tracker with full CRUD operations.

âœ¨ Features
This application comes packed with features designed to demonstrate both modern web development practices and PWA functionality:

Full CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks seamlessly.

Dynamic Categories: A free-flowing category system with autocomplete suggestions based on previously used categories.

Task Filtering: Filter tasks by their status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).

Dynamic Sorting: Sort the task list by category, task description, or status in ascending or descending order.

Persistent State: Tasks are saved to the browser's localStorage, so your data persists between sessions.

Offline-First PWA: Fully functional as a Progressive Web App.

Installable: Can be installed on desktop and mobile devices for a native-app-like experience.

Works Offline: The service worker caches all necessary assets, allowing the app to load and function even without an internet connection.

Online/Offline Indicator: A clear UI element that shows the user's current connection status.

Responsive Design: A clean, custom-styled interface that works beautifully on all screen sizes.

PWA Learning Checklist: An in-app checklist that dynamically updates to help you learn and verify the core concepts of a PWA.
